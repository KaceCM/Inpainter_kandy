<p>A python GUI application to inpaint images.
</h3>

*Inpainting* is a set of image processing algorithms where damaged, missing or unwanted parts of an image are filled in using the neighbouring pixels. It can also be used to 
remove forground objects. This is a GUI application that helps you do just that. It has an interactive and user-friendly GUI for marking the regions of the images.

### Implementation
The frontend GUI is developed using PyQt. The backend inpainting operations are done using *OpenCV* library. Currently, *OpenCV* provides two algorithms for inpainting which are-
* cv2.INPAINT_TELEA: An image inpainting technique based on the fast marching method (Telea, 2004)
* cv2.INPAINT_NS: Navier-stokes, Fluid dynamics, and image and video inpainting (Bertalm√≠o et al., 2001)

Later on, I'll try to incorporate recent deep learning methods that perform way better than these classical image processing algorithms.

### Contribute
Feel free to fork the project and contribute. You can incorporate recent deep learning methods, make the GUI more easy to use, include relevant photo editing features.
