<p>A python GUI application to inpaint images.
</h3>

*Inpainting* is a set of image processing algorithms where damaged, deteriorating, or missing parts of an artwork are filled in to present a complete image. It can also be used to 
remove forground objects. This is GUI tool that helps you do just that. It is interactive and user-friendly GUI for marking the regions of the images.

### Implementation
The frontend GUI is developed using PyQt. The backend inpainting operations are done using *OpenCV* library. Currently, *OpenCV* provides two algorithms for inpainting which are-
* cv2.INPAINT_TELEA: An image inpainting technique based on the fast marching method (Telea, 2004)
* cv2.INPAINT_NS: Navier-stokes, Fluid dynamics, and image and video inpainting (Bertalm√≠o et al., 2001)

Later on, I'll try to incorporate recent deep learning method that perform way better than these classical image processing algorithms.
